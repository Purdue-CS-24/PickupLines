# Computer Science Pickup Lines
A congregation of pickup lines from Computer Science majors in Purdue's Class of '24

-----

- Are you CSPickupLines? Because I'm too intimidated to commit to you.
- Are you recursive? Because I’ll do you over and over again.
- I am a pointer to you because my D gets pointy as hell.
- Hey girl, I just reduced this matrix and all I see is a linear dependency between me and you.
- We should be an infinite while loop so we never have to break.
- Are you the main branch? Cause I wanna push a child into you.
- I just row reduced a matrix and all I can see is a dependency between you and me.
- ssh me@yourDMs
- I think I'm a malloc function, cuz I'm always ready to make memories with you
- Are you vim? Cuz I can't pull out of you
- Are you an iteration? Because I want to be in the next step of your life
- Are you a functor? Cause I wanna apply myself to ur interior.
- Are you a function? Cause I wanna bind with IO to make you impure.
- Are you a Mutex? Cause I wanna lock you and access your contents.
- Are you JavaScript? Cause ur fucking stupid.
- Are you an exception? Because I want to catch you
- If I stuck your beauty into an integer it would definetly overflow. We would need like, a big integer for that.
- Are you a Mutex? Cause I want exclusive access to you.
- Do you require a standard library? Cause I wanna use you with #[no_std]
- Hey baby, there's an OverflowException in my pants, care to handle it for me?
- Baby, you make my floppy disk turn into a hard drive
- Baby, you're the only accept state of my finite automaton
- So for this English paper, I need to write about the finer things in life. Mind if I interview you?
- I wish I was cross eyed, so that I can see you twice
- Have you had a raisin before? Yea? Okay, what about a date?
- I'd intern at your place every weekend
- It would be dishonest to say I only want to be academic with you
- Baby if you were github, I would commit to pushing my branch into you every day
