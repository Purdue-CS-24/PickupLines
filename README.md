- Are you CSPickupLines? Because I'm too intimidated to commit to you.
- Are you recursive? Because Iâ€™ll do you over and over again.
- I am a pointer to you because my D gets pointy as hell.

- We should be an infinite while loop so we never have to break.
- Are you the main branch? Cause I wanna push a child into you.
- I just row reduced a matrix and all I can see is a dependency between you and me.
